To Do List

   or may not end up in XRoads. In other words, don't trust it */

***********************
*** The Basic Stuff ***
***********************

<*DONE*> Rearrange so that each entity has it's own information, and
<*DONE*> redraw using that instead.

<*N/A*> Seperate info for wall tiles? (redraw characters, then walls)

<*DONE*> Keep grid matrix for collision detection purposes (Hold entity ID
<*DONE*> in matrix instead. Easier collision detection/attacking then)

<*DONE*> Find a way to use integer arrays for graphics instead of chars

<*DONE*> Incorporate all tiles into single array (may be hard, considering
<*DONE*> animation frames, spars=3 frames, walls/bullets/etc=1)
<*DONE*> -OR-
<*DONE*> Huge indexed array. Keep variables pointing to 1st, 2nd, and 3rd
<*DONE*> frames of animation inside array (creature.frame1, etc) would be
<*DONE*> 3D array instead of 4. MAJOR alterations (not pointers, integer
<*DONE*> references to tiles)
<*DONE*> -OR-
<*DONE*> Incorporate tile into creature structure
<*DONE*> -OR-
<*DONE*> Make data[].frame1, frame2, etc pointers that point to tiles

         NOTE: Did the last one... data[monsterid].tile[0], [1], etc

<* Still needs some evolution *>
Define standard structures for entities including:
	X, Y Coordinates
	Entity Type
	Animation frame
	Direction
	Speed
	Health
	Status:
		Invulnerable?
		Invisible?
		etc..?
	Power-up time left (For newer powerups)
	...?

<* Still needs some evolution *>
Define standard structures for creature information:
	Color
	Speed
	Initial health
	Attack types (2? more?)
	Attack speed (Same as normal speed?)
	Difficulty (?)
	Frames of animation (0 for walls, 2 for spars, else 1)
	Wrapping animation, or remove after finished? (Explosions)
	Animation repeats before removal (for powerups)
	Tile index(s) / Tile(s) itself
	Point value (Difficulty?)
	Game association ('Roads 1, 2, both, new)
	Extended info:
		Bullet/automatic?
		Rubberhead?
		Alliances?
		Special abilities?
	Intelligence (0 for projectiles, 1=random movement, 2=light 
                      homing, 3=search and destroy)
	...?

<*DONE*> Put all creature/constant/etc definitions into seperate file
<*DONE*> (tiles at least)

<*DONE*> Will most likely need a Makefile at this point

<*DONE*> Create a main loop that polls for events instead of waiting

<*DONE*> Have entities move on their own during game loop, check speed

<* Still needs some evolution *>
Define various attack types:
	Melee
	Projectile
		Bullet
		Arrow
		Worm (For rubberheads)
	Vaccuum

Add additional keys:
<*DONE*>Quit   (Esc)
<*DONE*>Redraw (R)
<*DONE*>Pause  (Pause or P)
	...?

<*DONE*> Standard maps

<*DONE*> Put maps in files?

<*DONE*> "Slippery" walls? (This is hard to explain, but it's the best way
<*DONE*> I can think of describing it) (Keep old direction, and if new one
<*DONE*> not valid, try going in the same direction as before (Note: Make
<*DONE*> sure you actually can still move in that direction))

<*DONE*> 8x8 grid for "half steps" (Use integer number of 0.5's for grid
<*DONE*> location?
<*DONE*> Note: Can't be in two half-steps at once, must slide into one
<*DONE*> ahead)

<*DONE*> Alter draw_tile to use a #defined constant (variable?) for grid
<*DONE*> size. Use for loop

<*DONE*> Collision detection for attacks/spars/etc

<*DONE*> Add in projectiles

<*DONE*> Simple explosion animation (Just 8x8 tiles)

<*DONE*> AI for creatures

<*DONE*> Alliances for creatures (Foes, grudges, etc)

Demo mode (Wouldn't necessarily need alliances, though would be boring)

<*DONE*> Monochrome support

<*DONE?*> Low bit depth support [Seems to work fine in 8 bit now...]

Make more maps, and make them selectable

Clean up window/Xserver startup (Probably quite messy)

<*DONE*> #ifdef all the debugging messages so people can #undef DEBUG to
<*DONE*> ignore them all

Write documentation/manual (man page? html?)

<*DONE*> Finished up that Makefile yet?

<*DONE*> Set up web page

**************************************************
*** Should hopefully be playable at this point ***
**************************************************

<*DONE!*> 2 Player mode! [4 players at once actually]

<*DONE*> Create scorebar along top (fonts? tiles for letters?)
-OR-
<*N/A*> Create seperate window for score (Make this an option?)

Allow draw_tile to resize dynamically, ie. use +/- to resize screen, and
make the constant a variable (Problem: Font changes?)

Create icon for window managers

Create scoring scheme

High score list

High kills/spars/level/etc lists

<*DONE*> Create speed-up spars

Tagteam/mutant cooperation

<*DONE*> Rubberheads rebounding bullets

Eggheads "cloaking"

<*DONE*> Vaccuums weapon (Vaccuums currently helpless)

<*DONE*> Skulls speeding up when eating a spar

<*DONE*> Enemies picking up spars

<*DONE*> Better enemy target choosing <--- Important

(Better) Explosion for creation/death (16x16?)

Settings menu/interface (Long ways off.. widgets?), change settings and
turn off options (Pandemonium mode)

Control configuration (Run time)

Run-time loaded character set (Themes?)

<*DONE*> Use cursor keys for movement instead (Need to learn keysyms)
<*DONE*> Maybe use F-keys for some secrets?

Pandemonium mode:
	Creatures 'port in randomly
	Spars 'port in randomly
	Include old characters option

<*DONE*> Command line parameters:
<*DONE*> 	Speed?
        	Map file to use (create custom maps)
	        Color of player?
<*DONE*>        Display to use (segfault when no display found)
	        Size of tiles (8x8, 16x16, 32x32? higher?)
	        ..?

~/.xroadsrc file? Appdefaults?

Fix bugs and adjust feel of game

Hopefully optimize a lot

**************************************************************

		Hallucination? (Rather extreme)
		Teleportitis
		Slowdowns (bullets/running speeds)
		..?

		Vaccuum? (Would be difficult to program, but fun to use!)
		..?

Secrets:
	Access:
		Codes at main menu?
		Command line parameters?
		Key combinations?
		Environment variables?
		Type in during game? (Keep stack of keypresses, and
			compare against strings)
		All of the above?
	Hints?:
		Every 10th level (20th?)
		On high scores?

		Change colors
		Hidden messages (credits, greets, etc)

		More powerups
		Invulnerability/Invis/Juggernaut/Speed/etc
		Play as a creature
		Debug mode (Hit I for Invisibility, other keys...)
		..?

Maze editor? (Files are basic ASCII anyways, vi works if you're careful)

Non mirror maps? (I find Mirrored maps best)

Multi-colored tiles / XPM based tiles (Can anyone teach me XPM's without
Imlib/etc? :)

Colorful main screen/main menu (XPM based most likely)

Re-write in C++, use classes for characters? (Not bloody likely)

Client/Server interface for network games? (Don't hold your breath)
