This directory contains xbm's of the C64's character set. Basically, I
used VICE, xmag, and bitmap to make all of these. Not all of them are used
in XRoads however. For example, the British Pound symbol, and Pi aren't
yet used. Also, some of them were made by me. The ones I made are:

l_curly.xbm
r_curly.xbm
pipe.xbm
backslash.xbm
tilde.xbm
underscore.xbm
carat.xbm

The up arrow and left arrow are here, and originally replaced carat and
underscore in the original C64 ASCII set (aka PETSCII)
